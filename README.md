# bullet_hell_2d
Super simple top-down shooter game in custom engine.<br/>
<br/>
Made in 5 days, and I will not work on it anymore, except maybe fixing some bugs if anyone is interested.<br/>
Uses OpenGL for rendering.<br/>

## basic info
All the gameplay code is in **game.cpp**, and it's interfacing with the engine through few basic functions.<br/>
The engine is kinda garbage, and there are still some bugs, but does the job :)<br/>
There is no audio, too bad.<br/>
<br/>
## how to build
g++ or clang++ required.<br/>
run **build.bat** in terminal, result is in **build\game.exe**<br/>
<br/>
## dependencies (everything included)
**GLFW** (dll version) - for opening window and input<br/>
**GLAD** - for loading OpenGL<br/>
